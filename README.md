Account Number Generation:
	•	Unique account numbers for new customer accounts are generated using an incremental approach. A global variable (lastAccountId) is initialized with a starting value (e.g., 1000). Each time a new account is created in the new_acc() function, lastAccountId is incremented, and the incremented value is assigned as the account number for the new account. This ensures that each account receives a unique identifier.
	2.	Random Number Generation for Credit Card Numbers:
	•	When customers apply for new credit cards, random card numbers are generated for them using the rand() function provided by the C standard library. The rand() function generates pseudo-random numbers, and to ensure uniqueness, the generated numbers are typically combined with other factors such as timestamps or unique identifiers. In this project, the card number generation logic might involve generating a random number within a certain range and associating it with the customer’s account.
Of course! Let's provide answers to the questions generated earlier about the bank management system project:

1. **Project Overview:**
   - The bank management system project aims to provide a software solution for managing customer accounts, transactions, credit card services, and related banking functionalities. It facilitates various banking operations, such as account creation, fund transfers, credit card applications, balance inquiries, and statement generation.

2. **Functionality:**
   - The system allows users to create new accounts by providing personal details and an initial deposit.
   - Users can perform transactions, including deposits and withdrawals, to manage their account balances.
   - Fund transfer functionality enables customers to transfer money between their accounts or to other accounts within the bank.
   - Customers can apply for credit cards, which are assigned unique card numbers, and make payments towards their credit card balances.
   - The system provides options to view customer profiles, including account details, balances, and credit card information.
   - Bank statements can be generated to provide transaction histories and account summaries.
   - Customers can also request account deletion if needed.

3. **Account Management:**
   - Unique account numbers are generated for new accounts using an incremental approach, where each account is assigned a unique identifier starting from a predefined value (e.g., 1000).
   - Error handling and validation checks are implemented during account creation and transaction processing to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid inputs.

4. **User Interface:**
   - The user interface presents a menu-driven system where users can select various banking options using numerical choices.
   - Prompts and messages are provided to guide users through different functionalities and to indicate successful or failed operations.

5. **Error Handling and Security:**
   - The system incorporates error-handling mechanisms to address invalid inputs, runtime errors, and exceptional scenarios gracefully.
   - Security measures include data encryption, access controls, and secure storage practices to protect customer data and transactions from unauthorized access or manipulation.

6. **Currency Conversion Feature:**
   - Currency conversion functionality allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using predefined exchange rates relative to USD.
   - Exchange rates and currency codes are stored in arrays within the system, and user input is validated to ensure accurate conversions.

7. **Scalability and Maintenance:**
   - The system is designed to handle a significant number of customers and accounts, with scalability considerations taken into account during the development process.
   - Code maintainability is facilitated through well-organized code structures, documentation practices, and adherence to coding standards.

8. **Testing and Validation:**
   - The system undergoes rigorous testing using various methodologies, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
   - Test cases cover critical functionalities and edge cases to validate system behavior and ensure reliability.

9. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Future enhancements may include additional features such as online banking services, account management tools, enhanced security measures, and integration with external financial systems.
   - Continuous feedback from users and stakeholders will drive further improvements and enhancements to meet evolving banking needs.

10. **Project Implementation Details:**
    - The project is implemented using a programming language such as C, with a modular structure and separation of concerns to facilitate maintainability and extensibility.
    - Design patterns and best practices are followed to ensure code quality, readability, and scalability.
